text = "Not only education programs, but also advanced safety equipment and software tools are what the steelmaker has been investing in. The list includes physical devices such as personal protective equipment but also an information technology-based system named “Safety Keeper” developed by in-house IT engineers. The safety data management system is an internal platform to address safety concerns. Shuble and his team are working on upgrading the system so that each employee can have real-time access to communications, policies, programs and procedures on their Android and Apple mobile devices. The assistance of technology at plant sites is crucial, particularly for cases of gas detection. Early this year, the company decided to obligate everyone working in potentially gas-exposed areas to wear personal monitors.“One of the biggest hazards in iron and steelmaking is carbon monoxide. In a raw sense, you cannot smell or see carbon monoxide,” he said. “And they need to rely on that technology to tell them whether they are being exposed to it.”The vice president is reviewing the adoption of high-tech monitors that can place where a lone worker is and what their instrument is reading from a safety perspective. “There’s still opportunities for improvement. Sometimes you also need to develop the infrastructure and the facility -- such as Wi-Fi capabilities -- so you can grid the facility and track employees more accurately.”When asked whether automation in the iron and steelmaking industry could replace human hands, thus eliminating human casualties, Shuble said the human element is inevitable. “You still need to rely on people. Still need human eyes in quality perspective, double checking the technology. And you still need the maintenance people, when technology breaks down, there’s still human element that interacts with technology,” he said. “So technology will help, but it will only help to a certain extent. I don’t see in my time that steelmaking will be fully automated.”Despite a commitment in safety, corporate hierarchy in Korea is still a hurdle for open communication, a key element for transparency in business."
